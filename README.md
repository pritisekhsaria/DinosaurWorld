# DinosaurWorld

Dinosaur World website is one camp, from a series of camps, designed to learn Web Development through projects.
This interactive website camp is designed to introduce students to the concept of web development. After doing this camp, if students are interested, we can schedule a more detailed course, in which we will cover all topics in depth. Another way to study further would be to do similar camps, slowly progressing in level of difficulty.

Please find attached the link for the interactive website. I request you to see the site on a computer as its not responsive. Also, you will not be able to see the hover effects on your phone.

This camp is a bit more challenging then the first one. In this camp, beside the basic HTML5 & CSS3 concepts, we will again cover list and links. In addition, we will see concepts like media and forms, not a part of the previous camp. After both these camps, they would be introduced to all the most commonly used HTML5 & CSS3 concepts and will learn JavaScript in more depth along with some basic programming concepts like variables and if..else.

Features of the project:
